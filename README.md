# Capstone-Project "PlanAhead"

This Capstone project is called PlanAhead which aims to create a minimalistic daily planner/note taker that help users of all ages to get ahead of their work.

In this application you will find a main page called Dashboard which allows user to make notes. It also provides a "Quote of the Day" which helps to motivate and keep their brains active, and changes everytime a user refreshes the page or logs back in. Another helpful component is a calendar.

Future adjustments to this project will help this application become more functional, visually apealing and more interactive. Such as styling of components and integrating notes into the calendar whilst setting time adjustments if deadline is due etc.
